# **My New Setup**
## Tuesday 5th June 2022 - 9:30AM
## Introduction
Welcome to another post, today I'm going to give you all a run down of my system.

## Hardware
I am using an Asus X553MA with a 4 core Intel Pentium N3540 @2.16GHz, 8GB of RAM and built in Mesa Intel HD Graphics, with a 1 TB HDD for storage.

## Operating System
I am running Manjaro KDE. KDE Plasma version 5.24.5; KDE Frameworks version 5.93.0; Qt version 5.15.3; kernel version 5.18.5-200.fc36.x86_64 (64-bit); and with X11 as the graphics platform.

## Day To Day Use
My daily use case for the device includes, schoolwork (whilst connected to school network) and art/content creation in the evenings (at home) as well as occational coursework.

## Main Software I Use
Web Browser - Brave Nightly<br>
File Manager - Dolphin<br>
Office Suit - LibreOffice<br>
Image Editing And Drawing - Krita<br>
Pixel Art - LibreSprite/Aseprite<br>
Email Client - Thunderbird<br>
Terminal - Kitty/Alacritty<br>
Terminal Text Editor - Micro<br>
Terminal Shell - ZSH<br>
Shell - ZSH<br>

## Reasons
The reasons behind the distro (Manjaro) is that I want to use Arch (as it's a rolling release), but I can't get vanilla Arch working. Manjaro offers a themed Arch experience with a calamares installer (which makes it easier to install). I tried Ubuntu but I don't like the fact that they push Snaps on you without informing you;I used Fedora for the best part of 5 months and honestly it was AWESOME, but I like the AUR and the high number of packages that are on Arch, and the rolling release.

If Fedora were to get their own AUR with lots of packages, then I would most likely move back to Fedora.
